sxg-republisher-extension
=========================

An demo extension that loads content from the *.ipfs.v6z.me subdomains
using an IPFS gateway and [HTTP Signed Exchanges](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2018/11/signed-exchanges).

Install it and try to load this page:

https://index-jimpick.ipfs.v6z.me/index.html

Note: The signed exchange files need to be republished every 7 days or
they expire ... so this demo may fail to work in the future.

For more information about the demo:
